                <h5 class="card-title">Interviews</h5>
                <p class="card-text">Our goal was to figure out who was involved, Who wanted to get involved but didn't know how to begin as well as staying up to date.

                    <b>The results of the interviews</b>
                    
                    This method was chosen because it proved to be the most efficient in getting real-time information from our interviewees. We conducted a total of seven interviews (in person and video) with people from different age groups and political views. After reviewing the information we noticed that they all had the same problem, not enough time in the schedules to get well informed and get involved. Some of the main insights we got from interviewing were; Not enough information on how to be involved, Lack of trust with news sits, and the fact that there is just too much information out there.</p>

                <h5 class="card-title">Persona</h5>
                <p class="card-text">We started with two proto-personas then later after the feedback from the interviews they became a single persona. We referred to her throughout the entire development process.

                    <b>Understanding the persona</b>
                    
                    To be able to understand how the application would work we needed a persona that would be an ideal user of it. The methods that were used to create her were doing some User Interviews to get our foot in the door. From the interviews, we concluded that her frustrations would be that too much information is being presented to her without knowing what's fact or fiction, some of her goals were to find easier ways to get involved as well as getting news on topics she was interested in personally. We referred back to her during the prototype process by asking ourselves how efficient and intuitive is the application for someone with a schedule that almost always filled up.</p>
